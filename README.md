First Section is to simulate the data following from normal distribution to present the advantage of modified covariates.

Second Section is to simulate the data to calculate the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficients of average treatment effect under the model with continuous response and binary response. The estimators fitting methods are Full Regression method, Modified Covariates method and full regression and augmented efficient method. The primary dimension reduction method is LASSO with 10-fold cross validation.
